 *  Using the time struct that we defined in the video clips above, write some code that will
 *  advance a given time by a specified number of minutes. To do this, declare a variable now
 *  of type time initialized to some particular value, and another integer variable advMins set
 *  to some initial value. Then, update the fields of now to show the time in advMins minutes.
 *  You can check and handle special cases using if-statements, and donâ€™t forget that you can
 *  also use the modulus (%) operator.
