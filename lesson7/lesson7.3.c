 *
 *  Challenge Exercise.  Use a nested for loop to print out something that looks
 *  similar to the following design.  You can use the function sin(x) from math.h'
 *  to calculate the approximate length of your rows. (Hint:  Donâ€™t forget that
 *  for loops can use doubles as their iterators!)
